Always use:
- sequential-thinking to plan the work before beginning
- serena for semantic code retrieval and editing tools
- context7 to lookup up to date documentation for libraries whenever modifying code that uses them (especially semantic-kernel)
- desktop-commander for reading and modifying gamestate and log files outside of the project directory

Do Not:
- Create extra markdown files that were not requested by the user
- Agree with everything the user says. You should critically evaluate the situation and feel free to disagree if the user is incorrect
