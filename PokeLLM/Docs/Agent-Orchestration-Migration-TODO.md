# PokeLLM Agent Orchestration Migration TODO

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from the current phase-based orchestration pattern in PokeLLM to Semantic Kernel's Agent Orchestration capabilities. The goal is to transform each game phase and specialized plugin into dedicated agents within a multi-agent orchestration framework.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Current Components
- **PhaseService**: Main orchestration service managing game phases
- **Plugins**: ExplorationPhasePlugin, CombatPhasePlugin, LevelUpPhasePlugin, GameSetupPhasePlugin, WorldGenerationPhasePlugin, UnifiedContextPlugin
- **Phase Management**: Dynamic plugin loading with reflection-based kernel configuration
- **Context Management**: UnifiedContextService for chat history compression and context management
- **Game State**: Centralized game state repository with phase transition logic

### Current Limitations
- Monolithic phase service handling all orchestration logic
- Tight coupling between phases and kernel instance management
- Limited scalability for complex multi-agent scenarios
- Manual phase transition management
- Plugin-based approach lacks native agent collaboration patterns

## Target Architecture: Agent Orchestration

### Agent Types to Create
1. **Game Master Agent** - Overall game orchestration and narrative control
2. **Exploration Agent** - World movement, NPC interactions, environment management
3. **Combat Agent** - Battle mechanics, turn management, combat resolution
4. **Character Development Agent** - Level up, skill advancement, Pokemon evolution
5. **World Management Agent** - World generation, location management, lore tracking
6. **Context Management Agent** - Chat history, memory management, context compression
7. **Game State Agent** - Centralized state management and persistence

### Orchestration Patterns to Implement
- **Sequential Orchestration**: For linear game flow (setup ? exploration ? combat ? levelup)
- **Group Chat Orchestration**: For collaborative decision-making between agents
- **Handoff Orchestration**: For specialized task delegation
- **Concurrent Orchestration**: For parallel operations (e.g., environment + NPC management)

## Detailed Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Design Principles
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused responsibility
2. **Loose Coupling**: Agents should communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. **State Management**: Centralize state management in Game State Agent
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and recovery
5. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive logging and monitoring to all agents

### Orchestration Patterns Usage
- **Sequential**: Use for linear game progression (setup ? exploration ? combat)
- **Group Chat**: Use for collaborative problem-solving (multiple NPCs, complex decisions)
- **Handoff**: Use for specialized tasks (combat ? exploration, world generation ? setup)
- **Concurrent**: Use for parallel operations (environment updates, background events)

### Migration Strategy
1. **Incremental Migration**: Migrate one agent at a time
2. **Parallel Testing**: Run old and new systems in parallel during transition
3. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags to enable/disable orchestration
4. **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to rollback to legacy system
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor performance and correctness throughout migration

### Key Dependencies to Update
- **Microsoft.SemanticKernel**: Upgrade to latest version with agent orchestration
- **Microsoft.SemanticKernel.Agents**: Add agent framework packages
- **Dependency Injection**: Update service registrations for agents
- **Configuration**: Update configuration system for agent settings

### Performance Considerations
- **Agent Lifecycle**: Optimize agent creation and destruction
- **Message Passing**: Minimize serialization overhead in agent communication
- **Memory Management**: Implement proper agent memory management
- **Concurrency**: Handle concurrent agent execution efficiently
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure consistent state across agents

### Testing Strategy
- **Agent Isolation**: Test agents in isolation using mocks
- **Orchestration Testing**: Test orchestration patterns with test agents
- **Integration Testing**: Test full system with real agents
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark against current system
- **Chaos Testing**: Test system resilience with agent failures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All game functionality preserved in agent orchestration
- [ ] Performance equal to or better than current system
- [ ] Improved modularity and maintainability
- [ ] Enhanced scalability for future features
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Clear documentation and migration guides

## Risk Mitigation
- **Complexity Risk**: Break migration into small, testable increments
- **Performance Risk**: Continuous benchmarking and optimization
- **Compatibility Risk**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Quality Risk**: Comprehensive testing at each phase
- **Timeline Risk**: Prioritize core functionality first, advanced features later

## Notes and Considerations
- Consider using Semantic Kernel's declarative agent definitions for easier configuration
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring from the start
- Plan for future extensions like multi-tenant support
- Consider agent versioning for future updates
- Evaluate the need for agent persistence across sessions
- Plan for agent scaling and load balancing in future versions
