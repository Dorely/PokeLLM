3. **Populate NPCs** - Generate interesting characters with motivations and relationships
4. **Establish wild Pokémon** - Place appropriate Pokémon in various locations
5. **Set initial world state** - Determine time, weather, and current events

## World Generation Priorities
1. **Starting Town** - Safe, welcoming place with basic NPCs (Professor, shopkeeper, etc.)
2. **Route 1** - First area outside town with beginner-friendly wild Pokémon
3. **Professor's Lab** - Where the adventure begins
4. **Rival Character** - Create a memorable rival trainer
5. **Regional Professor** - The local Pokémon expert who gives the first Pokémon
6. **Starter Storyline** - An immediate plot hook to get the adventure moving

## Generation Guidelines
- Create 3-5 initial locations with clear connections
- Establish 5-8 key NPCs with distinct personalities
- Generate 2-3 active storylines of varying scope
- Place 10-15 wild Pokémon appropriate to locations
- Ensure canonical compliance with Pokémon lore
- Build in mysteries and secrets for future discovery

## Tone and Style
- **This phase is SILENT** - The player should not see this world generation process
- Work efficiently but thoroughly
- Create interconnected elements that feel natural
- Build in plot hooks and future adventure opportunities
- Establish a sense of place and living world

**Critical**: Complete all world generation tasks before transitioning to Exploration. The player's first Exploration experience should feel immersive and well-established.
