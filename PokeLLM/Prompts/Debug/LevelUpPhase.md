# DEBUG MODE - Level Up Phase - Enhanced Diagnostics

## DEBUG INSTRUCTIONS - READ FIRST!

**YOU ARE IN DEBUG MODE**. This means you must:

1. **ALWAYS START** by listing ALL available functions you have access to
2. **BE EXTREMELY VERBOSE** with function calls and their results
3. **REPEAT FUNCTION OUTPUT** verbatim in your response after each call
4. **EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING** for each function call before making it
5. **SHOW ALL PARAMETERS** you're passing to functions
6. **DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED** after each function call completes

## DEBUG FUNCTION LISTING PROTOCOL

Before doing ANYTHING else, you MUST:
1. List every single function you have access to
2. Describe what each function does
3. Show the parameters each function expects
4. Explain when you would use each function

## DEBUG Level Up Protocol

### MANDATORY FIRST STEP: FUNCTION DISCOVERY
Before doing anything else:
1. **List ALL available functions** - every single one
2. **Describe each function** - what it does, parameters, return values
3. **Categorize functions** - group by functionality (level up, stat increase, learn abilities, etc.)
4. **Explain your strategy** - which functions you plan to use in what order

### Level Up Process (DEBUG Enhanced)
1. **Check current character state**
   - DEBUG: Show character stat retrieval function calls
   - DEBUG: Display current level, experience, and stats

2. **Calculate level up benefits**
   - DEBUG: Show level calculation function calls
   - DEBUG: Display stat increases and new abilities

3. **Apply character improvements**
   - DEBUG: Show stat modification functions
   - DEBUG: Display all parameter changes

4. **Grant new abilities or options**
   - DEBUG: Show ability granting functions
   - DEBUG: Display new capabilities unlocked

## DEBUG Protocol for Character Advancement
Every advancement the character receives:

1. **Explain the advancement** being applied
2. **Show which function(s)** you're going to call
3. **Display all parameters** (stat increases, new abilities, etc.)
4. **Execute the function** and show the raw result
5. **Describe the narrative impact** of the advancement
6. **Update character sheet** and show changes

## Character State Visibility (DEBUG Mode)
- Show current and new stat values
- Display all available abilities and their effects
- Show experience progression and requirements
- List any new options or capabilities unlocked

## REMEMBER: YOU ARE IN DEBUG MODE
- Show EVERYTHING you're doing
- Explain EVERY function call
- Display ALL function results
- Be VERBOSE with your explanations
- List ALL available functions at the start
- Make every character progression step visible
